A simple WordPress plugin to create a custom post type called "Movies" with a release year input field in the admin panel

### Description

This plugin adds a new post type called **Movies** to your WordPress admin area  
When you create or edit a movie post, you wil see a small input where you can enter the **release year** for movie

### Learning Outcomes

1. Creates a **Movies** Custom Post Type in admin Dashboard
2. Allows to add/edit movies like regular posts
3. Adds a **"Release Year"** field in the movie post editor
4. Saves the release year to the database safely

### How It Works

1. **Register Post Type** The plugin registers a new post type called "movie".
2. **Meta Box** Adds a side box in the movie post editor to enter the release year.
3. **Save Field** When you publish or update the post, it saves the year to the database.

### Why I Built This 

I built this plugin to practice working with:
1. Custom post types
2. Meta boxes
3. WordPress database post meta
4. Admin UI

### Errors / Confusions

1. Confused with meta data like why and how it is used in wordpress
2. how the meta data will store in database
